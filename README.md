# ICS Telegram-Bot

This repository features a quick-and-dirty telegram-based bot that can load events from an *.ics calendar file and remind users prior to the events in that file. At the moment every event will trigger exactly one reminder. The day and time of the reminders can we set on a per-user base for all events. the bot also features localization and can be configured with a configuration file (see example config file).

## Installation

in a Terminal window navigate to the project root and type

```
bundle install
```
