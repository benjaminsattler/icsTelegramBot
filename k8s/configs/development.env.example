# Telegram bot token to use to connect to the telegram API
# You retrieve this by talking to the bot "Botfather"
BOT_TOKEN=111111111:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

# Defines the intervals at which the in memory data should be
# written to the database. Higher values mean less database load,
# lower values mean more protection against data loss
FLUSH_INTERVAL=600

# Defines a list of telegram users/groups that have advanced
# capabilities and may control the behaviour of the bot. Also,
# every user/group listed here will be pinged every time the
# bot is started.
#
# Separate values with a colon (":"), e.g.
# ADMIN_USERS=12345:23456:34567
ADMIN_USERS=111111111

# Define the persistence layer to use for the bot. Valid values
# are
# - mysql
# - sqlite
#
# Depending on what value you use here you need to fill in further
# configuration variables based on your choice here. See below
PERSISTENCE=mysql

# If your choice for PERSISTENCE was "sqlite", then you can specify
# the path to the sqlite database file using this variable. Notice
# that the path will be accessed from inside the docker container,
# so most likely you'll want to put a path to a file on a volume here,
# such as inside /db/
SQLITE_DB_PATH=/db/sqlite/dev.db

# If your choice for PERSISTENCE was "mysql", then you can specify
# the mysql server credentials in the next few environment variables.
MYSQL_HOST=mysql-devel
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USERNAME=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=example
MYSQL_DATABASE=icstelegrambot

# Path to the database migration files that will be used for migration
# every time the container starts. Notice that the path will be accessed
# from inside the docker container. Also note that depending on your choice
# for PERSISTENCE the path to the migration files differs. The default should
# usually be fine.
MIGRATIONS_DIR=/db/migrations/mysql/

# Specify the database connection string for the mgiration tool "dbmate".
# This is listed separately for security reasons (migrations need to alter
# database schemas, and the bot should not have these kinds of permissions).
# Also note that this environment variable will be used inside a docker
# container that is not deployed to kubernetes and is attached to the
# kubernetes node using docker's host network. The MySQL database is available
# on the kubernetes node on port 31235.
#
# For more information on how this database string needs to look like, please
# refer to the dbmate manual at https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:example@host.docker.internal:31235/icstelegrambot

# Specify the timezone that the bot should run in. Set this to the timezone
# in which your users will be. For a list of possible values please consult
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones and look for
# the values in the table column "TZ"
TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin
